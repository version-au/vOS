# vOS - Rainmeter Bar Skin

## Introduction

> Initially created this skin, as i was a heavy user of SharpE shell when it was active.
> Mainly made this for myself and friends who have enjoyed using it.

Has a fairly large selection of skins from music players, weather, cpu, ram, gpu, fps, recycle, app draw launcher, fans, drives, network and clock and calendar. Also has a color theme system based off choosing 6 colors. Presets are also provided.

This is my first Rainmeter skin so a lot of code was initially borrowed from other skins. I still need to get a list together of all the people to thank.
