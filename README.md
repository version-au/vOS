# vOS - Rainmeter Bar Skin

## Introduction

> Initially created this skin, as i was a heavy user of SharpE shell when it was active.
> Mainly made this for myself and friends who have enjoyed using it.

Has a fairly large selection of skins from music players, weather, cpu, ram, gpu, fps, recycle, app draw launcher, fans, drives, network and clock and calendar. Also has a color theme system based off choosing 6 colors. Presets are also provided.

This is my first Rainmeter skin so a lot of code was initially borrowed from other skins. I still need to get a list together of all the people to thank.

## Installation

> Install Plugins and skin and load which components you want to use. Open vOS settings by right clicking on a skin. Change the colors and other settings to match yours. You will need HWinfo to be able to get tempretures, GPU and Fan information.

Right click on Music player to enable WEB play or LOCAL play. Other settings for skins can be accessed with the right click menu. Web player works well with Youtube. Haven't tested it with anything else.

Some skins have an additional menu that will show more stats.

To setup HWINFO browse to vOS\@resources\HWiNFO.inc
Information on how to enable and also find the value you need are here: https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/

Some of the features such as weather may not work as it has not been updated for some time.
