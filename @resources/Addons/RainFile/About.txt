ABOUT

This is an addon for the Windows system monitoring application, Rainmeter (http://rainmeter.net). It sends a !WriteKeyValue bang command to Rainmeter, using a file or folder chosen by the user as the key's new value. 


-----------------------
INSTRUCTIONS

RainFile.exe may be called with up to 7 parameters:

    "C:\...\RainFile.exe" "Type" "SectionName" "KeyName" "FileName" "DefaultValue" ["Pieces"] ["debug"]
	
    PARAMETER     KIND      DESCRIPTION                                                 VALUES ALLOWED
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Type          Required  The type of item to be selected by the user.                "File" or "Folder"
    Bang          Required  The full bang to be fired with $FileList$ in place of       Full bang to be sent to Rainmeter.
                            the file input and &quot; in place of quotes.
    DefaultValue  Required  The default value, i.e. where the selection dialog starts.  Full address of any file or folder (according to Type)
    Pieces        Optional  The parts of the file or folder address to return: the      "DPNE", "PNE", "NE", "DPN", etc. Default is "DPNE" (all parts).
                            drive (D), path (P), name (N) and/or extension (E). If a
                            folder is being chosen, the extension will be blank.
    Debug         Optional  If true, RainFile provides detailed feedback as it runs.    "1" or "0"

The following is an example of a Rainmeter bang that calls RainFile.exe with all parameters:

	["#@#Addons\RainFile\RainFile.exe" "File" "!SetVariable Something &quot;$FileList$&quot; #CURRENTCONFIG#" "#CURRENTPATH#Image.jpg" "DPNE" "1"]
